    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Major Cause Of Greenhouse Effect</h2>
    
    
    <h3> Now that we know why the greenhouse effect is dangerous to the atmosphere,
    why don't we look into the major causes that increases the greenhouse gasses in our environment?
    <p> First and foremost, is the burning of fossil fuels. Although fossil fuel are a predominant
    aspect in our lives (for example, fueling cars), they also are a mjor contributor
    to the increase of greenhouse gasses. Burning of fossil fuels release carbon dioxide,
    which as we know it, is one of the extensive greenhouse gasses out there.</h3>
    
    <h3> Secondly, there's deforestation. Trees and plants are organisms that can take in
    cabron dioxide, therefore, reducing carbon emissions. So, it would be no surprise,
    that due to the cutting down of trees, there is a considerable increase in the
    greenhouse gasses. </h3>
    
    <h3> On the contrary, another this which is a major cause of the increase of greenhouse gasses is farming.
    Fertilizer used for plants and crops have Nitrous Oxide. Nitrous Oxide, like carbon
    dioxide, is one of the contributers to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. </h3>
    
    <h3> Lastly, is industrial waste and landfills. Industries and factories produce harmful gasses
    which are released in the atmosphere. Furthermore. landfills also release carbon dioxide and methane,
    which, as talked about previously, adds to the greenhouse gasses. </h3>
    
    <h2 style="color:rgb(253, 253, 253);">Effects Of Greenhouse Gasses</h2>
    
    <h3> Now that we know about the causes of greenhouse effect, it's equally important  to understand
    the effects it will leave behind.</h3>
    
    <h3> The most common effect, that you all may know about, is golbal warming. Global warming is the phenomenon
    of a gradual increase in the overall temperature. And since evrything is connected, global warming can lead
    to Climate Change. It refers to long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. However, another factor of
    climate change is the burning of fossil fuels and human driven activity.</h3>
    
    <h3> Another major concern if there's increasered greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is the acidification
    of water bodies. The greenhouse gasses mix with the rainwater and fall as acid rain. This leads to the acidification
    of water bodies.</h3>
    
    <h3> Smog and air pollution also concern the enviornemnt. Smog is generally formed by the accumilation of more
    greenhouse gases including nitrogen and sulfur oxides. The major benefactor to the formation of smog are the
    automible and idustrial emissions, agricultural fires, natural forest fires and the reaction of these chemicals
    among themselves </h3>
